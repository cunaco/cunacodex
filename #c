Eden with Celestia in.

Oh, that was nice! The goodness of living brings me so high to consider it full. (After a while). So here we are - the Gates of Heaven are ours. There are no one here. So empty and dark, like it was abandoned years ago. "Hey!" - she screamed. "We brought something to feed - from the grounds and the seas for the people of Heaven!". Still it was the same. "Ya-hoo?". There was no answer, so I tried to concern the mind with all the understanding and it came to me in words - "What do you have?" - the answer was. "What's the matter?" - the answer was. "What's the point?" - the answer was. "What kind of?"  - the answer was. 

And it came as the bird on the wing. For the moment it was breathtaking.

Celestia asked: What brought you to life? What do you know about? What is kind? Any propostions?

And there was the light. Wholesome, unreachable in it's power, saint and clear.

The Tree of the times. A gift of the time: a story.
Value: What is first? Quest: What's the deal? Quit: Whatever Take: What kind of?  

The Tree of life. The gift of living: a breathe.
What brought you to life? Where it belongs to? When does it takes? Why do you propose such a thing?

The Tree of knowledge. The gift of knowledge: freedom.
Let me see. O, who are there? M, do you feel good? I'm going to, check out. 

The Tree of an arm. The gift of an arm: unity.
Perception fools us, all the things are mortal. It relies on the idea, that there are nothing to hide for a goodness sake. So that's the native agreement. Can we fall in love, again?

The Tree of the sun and the moon. The gift of the sun and the moon: exchange.
Dead or alive, we must not leave it like this. At least we have to try. God knows it'll be right anyhow. HOORAY! 

The meeting Tree. The meeting gift: a brand. 
Tell me a story of yours, i'll try to catch your breath (let me breath you). The freedom is so clear, so near, so bright and pure. I hope we're gonna meet some sunny day. Just, if you find it good (if it's good for you) i wanna catch the take. Devil arm me, God defend me. The world it is, that's the path, the choice is written.

The Tree of love. The gift of love: a core.
What do you percept? What is conception? Accept the thing and complete the reception.

The Tree of a word. The gift of a word: genesis.
The hate in love was a message. Wisdom of madness. A will for life to power. A mysterious thing with a clair structure.

The Tree of a destiny. The gift of a destiny: experience.
How does it feel for now? Are you related with? Do you love? Let me open the path of yours.

The Tree of good and evil. The gift: a choice.
Is it or ain't? Are you in or out? True or false? Yes or not?
